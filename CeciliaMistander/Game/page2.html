          <h2>A hungry troll..</h2> <br />
        Since this cute troll is a hungry one,<br />
        and also fears nothing, he contiunes eating.<br />
        <br />
        It seems like the bear is a kind one,<br />
        so he sits down next to the troll and kindly asks: <br />
        "May I have a taste of that delicious hobbit?" <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        So the troll and the bear sits down together and share a meal!<br />
