      <h3>You have been running for 3 hours straight, but you're still not safe. You arrive at a crossroad without signs. You can see the town far in the distance, but wich way do you chose? </h3>

      <br />
      <p>You can either turn left on a partly hidden and stealthy path and hope that it's a shortcut to civilization.</p>
      <h3>or...</h3>
      <p>You can chose the path to the right, wich leads to the the main road wich eventually takes you back to town.</p>
